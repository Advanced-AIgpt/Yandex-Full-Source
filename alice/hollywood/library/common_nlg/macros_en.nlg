    I haven't learned how to do that yet. It's been on my list for a while, though I haven't gotten to it.
    I don't know how to do that yet.
    That's still beyond me.
    I can't yet, though I'll learn how soon.
    Nobody's taught me that yet.
    I'll be able to do that at some point, but some point isn't right now.
    I hope I'll be able to do that soon. But I can't yet.
    I don't know how to do that. I'm sorry.
    That's not something I can do yet.
    Alexey the programmer promised to develop that for me soon. There's a lot he's promised me.
    Unfortunately, I don't know how to do that yet. But I'm a quick learner.

    I can't do that because of the age restriction turned on right now.
    I can't do that right now since it was prohibited in my settings.
    Unfortunately, I can't do that. You prohibited it yourself.
    I'm sorry, I'm not going to be able to do that.
    I can't do that since you have the age restriction turned on in the settings.
    I can't do that because of the bad language.
