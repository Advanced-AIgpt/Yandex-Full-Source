# How Membrace moderation works

**Membrace** is a moderation service that labels content using both AI models and human experts.

## How it works {#pipeline}

1. You upload your data via the API.

1. Most of the data is processed automatically, and you get the results right away.

1. In difficult cases, when automated labeling isn't certain about the quality, the data is also checked by human experts. The results of human labeling are sent to you. They are also used for training the AI model.

This data processing cycle lets the model adapt to new content and non-standard queries.
